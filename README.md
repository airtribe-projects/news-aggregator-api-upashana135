NEWS-AGGREGATOR-API-UPASHANA135
---------------------------------------
In this project, multiple API endpoints have been developed to manage user-related operations. The user data is securely stored in a MongoDB database, where various database operations are performed. For enhanced security, user passwords are hashed before being saved in the database.

To ensure secure access to protected resources, JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication is implemented, allowing only authorized users to perform database operations. Additionally, the project integrates an external News API, which is fetched using Axios to provide real-time news updates.

This system ensures both security and efficiency, combining authentication, data management, and external API integration to deliver a seamless user experience. 

ðŸ“Œ Features
Register an User: An user is registered with name, email, password and news preferences.
Login an user: A registered user can logged in using email & password. A token will be generated after login.
Get user preferences: Retrive details of all the news preferences of the user. The user is authorized using the token.
Update user preferences: Update the preferences of the user. The user is authorized using the token.
Get the news headers: Get the news headers from an external API endpoint based on the preferences of the user.

ðŸš€ Getting Started
1. Install dependencies by "npm install"
2. Run "npm run test" to check the test cases.
